                <p>As a reader myself, I searched for more convenient access to classic literature than buying (or borrowing) and carrying

                <p>After a quick search I found Wolne Lektury - a free library providing large variety of classics.</p>
                <p>However, after trying to find my way around it I just had to give up. Oftentimes these books are difficult and require
                much effort to process. Maneuvering through chaotic menus and filters added unnecessary effort, discouraging from use,
                and the books, entirely.</p>

    ones, don’t suit the goal. However, many problems can’t be solved through improving UX. The app’s issues would have
